## Objectives
This study attempts to identify demographic traits of US home buyers. What factors make a household more likely to rent vs own? Once we identify these traits, where can we find potential home buyers?

## Methodology
I used the most recent [American Community Survey 5 Year Data](https://www.census.gov/data/developers/data-sets/acs-5year.html) from the US Census to collect demographic data on home owners and renters. This data set, released January 2020, uses data collected from 5 years of Census surveys (2014-2018) to estimate "social, economic, demographic, and housing characteristics of the U.S. population."
